7. Watch age restricted videos without logging in.
Came across an age-restricted video? Don't feel like logging in? But still wanna watch it? Because hey, it's age restricted!
Well, worry not. All you have to do is, remove "watch?" from the URL, and replace the "v=" with "v/". Press enter and enjoy the video.
